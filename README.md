# SortingAlgorithmComparison
For my final project in CMSC389W (Visualization Through Mathematica) I createad a visual compairson of three basic sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort). I included a MP4 file that breaks down the code (which does not read well in github) and shows the applications of the program. I also included a image of the program.
